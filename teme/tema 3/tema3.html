    <h1>KEEP.IT.SIMPLE.</h1>

    <h2>Wait,what?</h2>
    <p>Wait a minute.I said I wanted simple,but not boring.What is up with the design?There's nothing on it but white space and some text and a minimal picture.
        That's not what I had in mind.The type is all in Helvetica,which I like,but it doesn't excite me at all.There is just no character to anything here.
        It has a minimal look,but it's just to vanilla.I really need something to grab the attention of a visitor to the site and this just doesn't do it.
